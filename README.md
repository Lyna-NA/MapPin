>Overview
MapPin is a full-stack travel application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to pin locations on a map and share their experiences and reviews with other users.

The frontend of the app is built using React.js and uses hooks for state management. The app also uses Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library, to display the map and allow users to interact with it.

The backend is built using Node.js and Express, which handle HTTP requests and responses, as well as API routing. MongoDB is used as the database to store user data, including location pins, reviews, and user information.

Users can sign up on the app, which allows them to save their favorite locations and see other users' pins and reviews. They can also add their own pins to the map, including descriptions, and ratings.
